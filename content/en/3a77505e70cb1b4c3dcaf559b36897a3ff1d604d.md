        text: "## Editing  \n\n### Location  \n\nThe Content nodes are located under the \"Content\" tab in the CMS. They are instances of [Schemas](/docs/schemas/) populated with input fields for authors to edit.\n\n### Fields  \n\nEach field can be a different [Schema](/docs/schemas/) as well, meaning for example a simple string of text, a number, a date, a dropdown menu, a list of other fields, or almost anything else one could imagine.\n\n### Tabs  \n\nContent nodes can have tabs at the top for dividing fields into subsets. The default tab, which will always be there is the \"meta\" tab, where information not directly related to content authoring is.\n\n### Saving  \n\nWhen an author edits and saves a Content node, they are registered as either the creating or the last updating user, depending on which is appropriate."

        text: "## Publishing\n\n### The settings dialog\n\nAs with everything in the left side pane of the HashBrown interface, every content node has a context menu, which is invoked with a right click. From here, you can click \"settings\" to reveal a dialog with a few configuration options.\n\n### Publishing setting\n\nOne of them is \"publishing\". If you have set up any [Connections](/docs/connections/), they will be selectable in this dialog with a switch. If one or more connections are switched on, the \"save\" button in the bottom of the Content editor will instead read \"save & publish\". This means that when an author clicks it, the edited Content node is then processed through each of the enabled [Connections](/docs/connections/). This process would most likely be sending the edited Content properties to a website where it will be displayed.\n\n### Unpublishing\n\nThe option to \"unpublish\" will also appear, meaning simply to remove the remote content that was previously published through the same [Connections](/docs/connections/).\n\n### Scheduling\n\nAll Content can be publishing and unpublished at a given time. Under the \"meta\" tab, you can edit both of these dates."
