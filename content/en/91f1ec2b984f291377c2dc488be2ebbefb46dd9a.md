        text: "## Features\n\n### Remote management\n\nSeparate your concerns with a truly modern approach to content management. Your website won't know what hit it.\n\n### Multiple projects at once\n\nWhy worry about several CMS'es, when you only need one?\n\n### Several environments for each project\n\nWe get it. You need to test your content before you go live.\n\n### Multilingual\n\nRemember the last time you used a truly elegant localisation solution in a CMS? We don't either.\n\n### Plugin support\n\nIf your needs aren't met at the core level, you can add anything you can imagine.\n\n### Content format consistency\n\nWhen you are passing complex, format-agnostic data around, document databases are the way to go. HashBrown knows what's up.\_\n\n### Painless backups\n\nHashBrown has your back in seconds.\n\n### Small footprint\n\nYou could probably run HashBrown on your toaster at home."
