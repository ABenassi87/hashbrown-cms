        text: "# Welcome to HashBrown\nHere's a quick overview of what you're seeing when you first open up the CMS. Some of these sections are \"scoped\", meaning that only certain users will have access to them.\n\n### Content\nWhere all of the authored work is. The content is a hierarchical tree of nodes that can contain text and media file references, in both simple and complex structures. It all depends on how you set it up.\n\n### Media\nAn asset library for your hosted files, such as images, videos, PDFs and whatnot.\n\n### Forms\nIf you need an input form on your website, you can create the model for it here and see a list of the user submitted input.\n\n### Connections (scoped)\nA list of endpoints and resources for your content. Connections can be set up to publish your content to other servers, provide statically hosted media and serve rendering templates.\n\n### Schemas (scoped)\nA library of content structures. Here you define how your editable content looks and behaves. You can define schemas for both content nodes and fields.\n\n### Users (scoped)\nAll of the users connected to this project. Here you can edit scopes and remove/add new users.\n\n### Settings (scoped)\nThe global project settings, such as which languages are in use.\n"
