        text: "## Purpose  \n\nThe idea behind connections is that they facilitate communications between the CMS and your websites, or any other endpoint you might have. This might seem a bit strange, if you're used to the website and the CMS being one and the same thing, but this means that you can publish the same content to many different sites at once, or use free hosting services like [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which this website is actually hosted on."

        text: "## Publishing  \n\nWhen a user clicks \"save & publish\" after editing a [Content](/docs/content/) node, it is saved in the HashBrown backend, but then the Connections assigned to this [Content](/docs/content/) take over. Depending on which type of Connection it is, it will convert the authored content to a format readable by the destination and send it there. Thus separating the tasks of authoring and displaying content completely from one another."

        text: "## Providers  \n\nConnections can be marked as providers of certain resources.\n\n### Template provider  \n\nAn example is that you have a remote website linked through a Connection. The website knows how to render your [Content](/docs/content/), but HashBrown doesn't. It is only interested in the structure of your [Content](/docs/content/), not how it is presented to the viewer. If you set up a Connection as a [Template](/docs/templates/) provider, the remote website will tell HashBrown about the available [Templates](/docs/templates/) used for rendering, so they can be selected by a content author through a dropdown menu.\n\n### Media provider\n\nHashBrown doesn't have a place for your [Media](/docs/media/) files, such as images, video or pdfs, either. Another provider is needed for that. The Connection acting as this provider could be the same website that provides your [Templates](/docs/templates/), but it could also be a third party service, like an Amazon S3 bucket."
