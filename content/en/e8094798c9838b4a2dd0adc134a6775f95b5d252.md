        text: "## Abstract  \n\nSchemas are structures for [Content](/docs/content/) to be based on. Without this structure, the [Content](/docs/content/) would have no way of knowing how to structurally present itself, or what should be editable in it. A Schema can for instance define that a [Content](/docs/content/) node should have a heading in the shape of a string, and a body in the shape of rich text. There are of course many more field types to choose from."

        text: "## Content and fields  \n\nSchemas fall into 2 categories: [Content](/docs/content/) Schemas and field Schemas:  \n\n- A [Content](/docs/content/) Schema will determine the fields in any [Content](/docs/content/) node based on this Schema\n- A field Schema will determine which type of value the field is, like a string or a number."

        text: "## Inheritance  \n\nSchemas can inherit from one another, meaning that if a Schema is made a child of another Schema, it will inherit all of the parent's properties. If the same property is defined in the child and the parent Schema, the child properties are preferred."
