# Welcome to HashBrown
Here's a quick overview of what you're seeing when you first open up the CMS. Some of these sections are "scoped", meaning that only certain users will have access to them.

### Content
Where all of the authored work is. The content is a hierarchical tree of nodes that can contain text and media file references, in both simple and complex structures. It all depends on how you set it up.

### Media
An asset library for your hosted files, such as images, videos, PDFs and whatnot.

### Forms
If you need an input form on your website, you can create the model for it here and see a list of the user submitted input.

### Connections
###### (scoped)
A list of endpoints and resources for your content. Connections can be set up to publish your content to other servers, provide statically hosted media and serve rendering templates.

### Schemas
###### (scoped)
A library of content structures. Here you define how your editable content looks and behaves. You can define schemas for both content nodes and fields.

### Users
###### (scoped)
All of the users connected to this project. Here you can edit scopes and remove/add new users.

### Settings
###### (scoped)
The global project settings, such as which languages are in use.
