# Endomon CMS

## Vision
Endomon aims to be a lean, pluggable solution for connecting media files, written content and structural schematics in any way you want.

## Example setups
### Media files
You might not have a lot of room on your server, so you could store your media files in an S3 bucket.
You might have plenty of room, in which case you could just let the CMS host them.

You might have access to a MongoDB, in which case your could store written content there
You might want to version control your written content, in which case it could be on GitHub
