# Endomon CMS

## Vision
Endomon aims to be a lean, pluggable solution for connecting media files, written content and structural schematics in any way you want.

## Example setups
### Media files
You might not have a lot of room on your server, so you could store your media files in an S3 bucket.
You might have plenty of room, in which case you could just let the CMS host them.

### Content files
You might have access to a MongoDB, in which case your could store written content there

### GitHub setup
You could store your written content on a CMS branch of your GitHub website, while pushing baked content to a Jekyll site
